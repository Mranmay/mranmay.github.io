Hi I'm Mranmay Shetty an undergrad researcher interested in biologically-inspired and cognitive-inspired AI interning at Harvard Medical School under Dr Gabriel Kreiman working on computational models of working memory

Previously I worked on Multi-modal and Explainable AI for Object Detection with drone imagery under Dr Rahee Walambe at SCAAI where I did my undergrad thesis and machine learning for affective disorder detection with EEG and activity data at Avegen Healthcare. I also like playing video games in my free time and used to play Call of Duty professionally too at one point and got mentioned in liquipedia for being in one of the top 10 teams in South Asia.
